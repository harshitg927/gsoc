# Week 14

*(September 2, 2025 – September 8, 2025)*

## Meetings  

### Meeting 1 – September 2, 2025  

**Attendees**

* [Jan Altenberg](https://github.com/JanAltenberg)  
* [Shaheem Azmal M MD](https://github.com/shaheemazmalmmd)  

**General Topics**  
- The focus for the next two weeks will be on **PRs #3066 and #3083** to get them ready for merging.  
- Target set to merge these PRs for the **next release**.

- Shaheem and team will also do testing and report issues to Jan and Vaibhav.  

**Bugs**  
- Found issue with **reuse function in PR #3083**:  
  * De-selecting “import as *to be discussed*” was not reflected correctly.  
  * All decisions were imported as *to be discussed*.  
  * Passing of import options must be checked against recent changes ([#3110](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/pull/3110)).  
- Reported by Jan.  

**TODOs**  

*#3066*  
- Implement **per-user defaults** for SPDX report settings (comparable to upload settings).  
- Extend REST API with **OSSelot export options**.  

*#3083*  
- Based on upload name, automatically suggest a name for the OSSelot search field.  
- Make currently hardcoded URL(s) configurable.  


### Meeting 2 – September 5, 2025  

**Attendees**

**Discussions**  
- Target confirmed to **get PRs merged for the next release**.

## Updates
