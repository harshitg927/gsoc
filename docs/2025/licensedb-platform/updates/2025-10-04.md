# Week 14–17  

*(September 8, 2025 – October 4, 2025)*  

## Meeting  
No meetings were held during this period due to **mentor unavailability** and **mid-semester examinations**.  

---

## Updates  
- No major work was done during these weeks as mid-semester exams were ongoing.  
- The **GSoC 2025 closing ceremony** for 12-week contributors took place during this time.  
- Mentor unavailability also affected review timelines and project discussions.  
- All major PRs have been submitted and are awaiting review.  
- The **monorepo setup** remains the only pending task for completion.  

---

## Planning for Next Week  
- Resume active development once exams conclude and mentor returns.  
- Finalize and merge the **monorepo setup**.  
- Complete any pending documentation and ensure all PRs are reviewed and merged.
